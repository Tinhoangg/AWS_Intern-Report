### Introduction to AnTiScaQ (Anti-Scam Warning Platform)

**AnTiScaQ** is a cutting-edge **automated anti-scam warning platform** designed to protect users from increasingly sophisticated cyber threats. The core of the system lies in the power of **Open Source Intelligence (OSINT)** gathered through robust crawling tools, which perform deep analysis and risk verification for suspicious **phone numbers, email content, and domains**. AnTiScaQ’s breakthrough differentiator is its ability to provide **real-time risk scores**, enabling immediate detection, assessment, and alerting as soon as scam campaigns emerge. This continuously enriches the threat intelligence database to ensure maximum safety for both individual users and the community.

### AWS Solution Architecture Overview

**Solution Architecture:**

The **AnTiScaQ** ecosystem is built on a **Serverless** architecture, fully leveraging elite **AWS** cloud services to provide elastic scalability and **minimize operational costs**. Adhering to the core pillars of the **AWS Well-Architected Framework**, this solution ensures the system remains resilient, secure, and ready to handle massive traffic spikes whenever scam campaigns break out.

* **Compute & Logic Layer**
At the heart of the processing layer, the platform utilizes the combined power of **Amazon API Gateway** and **AWS Lambda** as the primary compute engine with **zero server management**. In this architecture, compute functions handle high-speed REST API queries for the threat database, while specialized Python functions execute asynchronous OSINT data collection workflows seamlessly.

* **Data & Persistence Layer**
To solve the challenge of real-time retrieval performance, the system relies on **Amazon DynamoDB** as its central NoSQL database, applying single-table design techniques to store intelligence records with sub-second latency. Alongside the database, **Amazon S3** is configured as a secure repository for unstructured data such as evidentiary images, while also serving as the host for all static assets for the web portal.

* **Security & Authentication**
To establish a fortified defense perimeter, the architecture deeply integrates **Amazon Cognito** for identity management, supporting authentication and granular Role-Based Access Control (RBAC). Complementing this, **AWS Secrets Manager** acts as a secure vault for automatically storing and rotating sensitive information like database keys and API tokens, while **AWS WAF** (Web Application Firewall) operates at the front line to protect API endpoints from botnet abuse and Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks.

* **DevOps & Monitoring**
To maintain feature velocity and ensure quality, the entire CI/CD pipeline is fully automated through **GitHub Actions**. On the networking front, **Amazon CloudFront** (CDN) is deployed in tandem with **Amazon S3** to deliver web interface content at maximum speed to global users. Finally, every system state—from API rate limits to data collection processes—is closely monitored by the duo of **Amazon CloudWatch** and **Amazon SNS**, automatically triggering instant alerts if the system encounters errors or detects unusual cost thresholds.
